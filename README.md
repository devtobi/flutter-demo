## Information

This project was created for teaching purposes.
It was used for a presentation at Munich University of Applied Sciences for the subject "Mobile Application Development" in summer semester 2020.

## Source

The project is based on a CodeLab by Google. I found it while doing some research and thought it would be a really good starting point especially for Flutter newcomers.
I modified parts of it and added additional explanations inside the code.
The original CodeLab can be found [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt1/index.html)
